# CR1DMOD
Matlab code for forward modelling of electrical and electromagnetic measurements on a 1D layered half-space

The code is described in the following publication:

Ingeman-Nielsen, T. and Baumgartner, F. (2006): CR1Dmod: A Matlab Program to Model 1D Complex Resistivity Effects in Electrical and Electromagnetic Surveys, Computers & Geosciences, Vol. 32(9), pp. 1411-1419. DOI:  [10.1016/j.cageo.2006.01.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2006.01.001)

# What works
Currently command line versions of the tools run under Matlab Version 2018b.
Two test cases are provided, see *test_vmd.m* and *test_of_temfwd.m*.

# Known limitations
The GUI will launch (2018b) but errors are thrown when pressing menus or buttons etc.
