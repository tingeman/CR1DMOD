# CR1DMOD
Matlab code for forward modelling of electrical and electromagnetic measurements on a 1D layered half-space

# What works
Currently command line versions of the tools run under Matlab Version 2018b.
Two test cases are provided, see *test_vmd.m* and *test_of_temfwd.m*.

# Known limitations
The GUI will launch (2018b) but errors are thrown when pressing menus or buttons etc.

Feel free to fix and submit a merge request...
